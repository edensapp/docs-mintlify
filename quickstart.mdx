<Tip>

</Tip>

We recommend setting up the workspace in the following way:


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="house" title="Create a workspace">
    You can name it as you want, and it'll be visible to your teammates and clients, but you can customize it for invoices later.
    The simplest way to create a new workspace is to go throw [onboarding](https://app.edensapp.com/onboarding). There will be an option to create a demo workspace with sample data in one click.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Working as a team?">
    If you’re working in a team — add teammates. You can invite only those who need to have access to the dashboard and use a time tracker.
    You can give full admin access to other users as well, this helps when you have business partners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Add clients">
    For each client, you can add their representatives and invite them to the workspace, optionally.
    Once client contact accepts invite he'll be able to view all issued invoices and timesheets (if you allowed to view them).
    Inviting clients is not necessary, you can still send invoices via email or by sharing its URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="briefcase" title="Create projects">
    Projects helps you organize your work and billing. For each project assign teammates who're working on it and set billing terms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="money-check-dollar" title="Billing terms">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="cash-register" title="Setup payment methods">
    Configure payment methods available to your client to pay for invoices. All payments proceed directly to you and Edens is not envolved in this process so we don't charge any fees.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="file-invoice" title="Create invoice">
    Experiment with invoices — create one and add some items. You can delete the invoice before it is issued.
    You can bill tracked time and get a timesheet with detailed view. This might be shared with a client, as you wish.
    Invoice is created in draft status, once you're ready to share it with client you need to issue it.
