## How to start using Edens?

<Tip>
Workspace setup usually takes 15 minutes, and you can also start with a demo workspace.
</Tip>

We recommend setting up the workspace in the following way:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="house" title="Creating a Workspace">
    To create a new workspace, simply name it as you want. It will be visible to your teammates and clients, and you can customize it for invoices later.
    The easiest way to create a new workspace is to go through the [onboarding](https://app.edensapp.com/onboarding) process. There will be an option to create a demo workspace with sample data in one click.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Working as a Team?">
    If you are working in a team, you can add teammates. You can invite only those who need access to the dashboard and use a time tracker.
    You can give full admin access to other users as well. This is helpful for business partners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Adding Clients">
    For each client, you can add their representatives and invite them to the workspace, optionally. Once a client contact accepts the invite, they will be able to view all issued invoices and timesheets (if you allow them to view them).
    Inviting clients is not necessary. You can still send invoices via email or by sharing its URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="briefcase" title="Creating Projects">
    Projects help you organize your work and billing. For each project, assign teammates who are working on it and set billing terms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="money-check-dollar" title="Setting Billing Terms">
    Set a default hourly rate for the project or an individual hourly rate for each member. This is necessary only if you are using hourly billing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="cash-register" title="Setting Up Payment Methods">
    Configure payment methods that are available to your clients to pay for invoices. All payments proceed directly to you, and Edens is not involved in this process, so we don't charge any fees.
    Learn more about available payment methods in the docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="file-invoice" title="Creating Invoices">
    Experiment with invoices by creating one and adding some items. You can delete the invoice before it is issued.
    You can bill tracked time and get a timesheet with a detailed view. This might be shared with a client as you wish.
    An invoice is created in draft status. Once you are ready to share it with the client, you need to issue it.
