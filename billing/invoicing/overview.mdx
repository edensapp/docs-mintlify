## Creating an invoice

To create a new invoice in Edens, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Invoices" page.
2. Click the "New Invoice" button.
3. Select the client for whom you are creating the invoice.
4. Add the project and time entries associated with the invoice. You can also add manual line items if necessary.
5. Customize the invoice as needed, including adding a due date, setting a discount, and a note.
6. Preview the invoice and make any necessary adjustments.
7. Click "Issue" to share the invoice with your client.

## How to send invoice to the client?

There are few options to send invoice once it was issued.

1. Get a public link and send it to the client in any way.
2. Download PDF and send it to the client in email or as you wish.
3. Click "Share" button and there will be "Send" button to send email with invoice link and PDF to the client.
You'll need to add a client contact with email address.

## Customizing invoice templates

Edens offers customizable invoice templates that allow you to tailor your invoices to your brand and style.

An invoice template represents the details of the invoice sender. You may want to send invoices within a single workspace but have them issued by various companies you own.
For example, you might have a separate LLC for consulting work and another for freelance writing.
Having multiple invoice templates allows you to easily switch between them and ensure that your invoices are sent out with the correct details.

To create or customize an invoice template, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Workspace" page in the left sidebar.
2. Click the "Invoice Templates" tab.
3. Click the "Create new" button to create a new template or select an existing template to edit.
4. Customize the template by adding your company logo, name, and contact information.
5. Preview the template to ensure it meets your needs.
6. Save the template to apply it to future invoices.
