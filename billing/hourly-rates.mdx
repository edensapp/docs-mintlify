Edens allows you to set up flexible billing to support both hourly-rate and fixed-price contracts. The hourly rate is used to calculate billing amounts for the time tracked. You can track time using Edens time tracker located in the sidebar or with the Telegram bot â€” more options are coming soon.

## How to set hourly rates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Billing currency">
    You may use different currencies for each project. Be sure the currency set is correct.

  <Step title="Default hourly rate">
    For each project, you can set a default hourly rate that will be applied to all project members. This is done on the project settings page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Individual hourly rate">
    It's possible to set an hourly rate individually for each project member. To do so, go to the project members page.
