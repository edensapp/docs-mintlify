## Overview

One of the most popular payment methods we support is wire transfer.
This is a simple and secure way for clients to pay you directly into your bank account.
We also support ACH transfer which is widely used in the US.

Another payment method that is becoming popular is using crypto wallets. This allows you to receive payments in cryptocurrency, and your clients can buy crypto using fiat on the invoice page.
This can be particularly useful for clients who prefer to pay in crypto or those based in countries with unstable currencies.

We know the importance of providing more options to our clients, so we're constantly working on adding more payment methods to Edens.
Next on the list will be Stripe, allowing your clients to pay using a credit or debit card and many other ways.
