## Who is a client?

One of the most important aspects of running a freelance business is keeping track of your clients. In Edens, a client represents an <b>organization</b> or <b>individual</b> you are working with, and it's essential to clearly understand who they are and what you need to do for them.

## Creating a client

To create a client in Edens, follow these steps:

1. Click the "New Client" button on the home page or the "Clients" page.
2. Fill out the client profile with the necessary information, including the client's name, contact information, and currency.
3. Save the client profile.

By creating a client profile, you can easily track your work for each client.


## Adding client contacts

Another way to organize your clients is by adding client contacts. These are the people who you are working with at the client organization.

To add client contacts in Edens, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Client" > "Contacts" page.
2. Click the "New Contact" button.
3. Fill out the contact information, including name, email, and role.
4. Save the contact.

By adding client contacts, you can easily manage who you need to communicate with and keep track of their role and responsibilities.

### Inviting client contacts

One of the best ways to give your client contacts access to the work you are doing for them is by inviting them to your Edens workspace.
This allows them to see projects, timesheets, and issued invoices, making it easy for them to stay informed and involved.

To invite client contacts to your Edens workspace, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Client" > "Contacts" page.
2. Click the "Invite" button.
5. Get the invitation link or send it to contact's email.

A client can see only time records added to issued invoices and only if you allowed to view invoice timesheet.
Learn more about this feature on the Invoices page.
