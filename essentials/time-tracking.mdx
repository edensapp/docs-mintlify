In Edens, you can track the time worked on your projects, both for internal purposes and for billing your clients.

Tracking time in Edens is easy and convenient, whether you prefer to use the Telegram bot or the web app.
You can also add time manually if you prefer. If you need to make changes to your time records, editing and deleting them is a simple process.

## Why Edens time tracking is different?

At Edens, we believe that trust between you and your clients is essential.
That's why we've built our time tracking feature to be different from traditional time tracking tools.

Unlike other time tracking tools that capture your screen or record your mouse movements and keyboard presses, Edens time tracking is completely private.
We do not capture any data, and we do not track your activity outside of Edens.

<Check>Our goal is to help you build and support trust with your clients, not to invade your privacy or make you feel like you're being watched.</Check>

We believe that trust is the foundation of any successful business relationship.
With Edens, you can rest assured that your time tracking data is private and that you have complete control over it.

So go ahead and focus on your work, knowing that Edens has your back.
