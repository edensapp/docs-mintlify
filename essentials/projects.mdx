## What is a project?

Creating a project in Edens allows you to keep track of your billing, invoice time spent on the specific project, and organize all the data stored in Edens.

Edens is not designed as a task management solution. We're recommending [Linear](https://linear.app) for such case.

## Creating a project

To create a project in Edens, follow these steps:

1. Click the "New Project" button on the home or "Projects" pages.
2. Fill out the name and client fields.
3. If you need to bill time for this project, set a default hourly rate. Individual rates for project members can be set after project creation.
4. If you want to use a currency other than the default, select it.
5. Choose teammates who will work on the project.
6. Save the project.

Once you've created a project, you can link it to teammates, clients, time entries, and invoices.

## Project roles and permissions

Here's an overview of the different roles and their corresponding permissions:

| User Role | Time Tracking | Invoices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Member | • Add time for yourself |  |
| • View / Edit / Remove own time entries (if they weren't attached to any invoice) | • No access |  |
| Project Admin | • Add time for any project member |  |
| • View / Edit / Remove time entries for any project member (if they weren't attached to any invoice) | • No access |  |
| Workspace Admin | • View any time entries |  |
| • Add / Edit / Remove time entries for any project member (if they weren't attached to any invoice) | • Full access |  |
| Client | • View only time entries attached to invoices where timesheet is included | • View invoices (but not in draft or void statuses) |

<Info>The workspace admin always has access to all projects in the workspace. Adding them as a member of a project is optional.</Info>

## Billing details

Billing details in Edens are only visible to workspace admins. This means that only they can view and manage billing information for each project.

If you want to learn more about project billing terms, you can check out our documentation here.

To track time spent on the project and bill it to the client, please set a default hourly rate for the project or individual rates for project members.
Note that the member rate will default to the project rate if not set. You can also set a rate of 0.
