## What is workspace?

Workspace is a dedicated area in Edens where you can manage your projects, clients, and invoices.
You can add teammates and clients to the workspace and invite them to join.

## Create a workspace

There are three options for creating a new workspace:

1. Follow the onboarding wizard on sign up.
2. Create a sample workspace with demo data to experiment with Edens. This can be done on the "Onboarding" page.
3. Create a new workspace by clicking "Create new workspace" in your workspaces list.

### Do I need to create a workspace?

- If you're running a business on your own as an independent freelancer or company, then yes.
- If you're working at another company, you don't need to create a workspace. Just ask your company owner to create one and invite you. If you're acting as a client, you also don't need to create a workspace. Please ask your contractor to create one and invite you.
- If you act as a client you also don't need to create a workspace, please ask your contractor to that and invite you.

<Info>We'll allow clients to create their workspaces and invite contractors at a later stage.</Info>

## Inviting other users

You can invite your teammates and clients to the workspace.

To invite a teammate, please [create a new team member](/essentials/team#adding-teammates) on the "Team" page.
If you wish to invite a client, please refer to our [documentation](/essentials/clients#creating-a-client).

## Custom domain

By default, your workspace is available on `app.edensapp.com`. Public invoices links will also include this URL.
You can customize it by configuring a custom domain. To do that go to "Workspace" > "Custom domain" page.

- Enter a domain name you'd like to use.
- Configure DNS using provided NS records.

Don't know how to set up NS records? Refer to docs of your registrar:

Please feel free to contact us if you need assistance with setting up your domain.

<Note>After adding records, click the "Refresh" button next to the domain status.</Note>

If the domain is set up correctly, you'll see a green icon and the status will change to "Valid".
Otherwise, please wait as the status will be updated automatically.

## Workspace billing

The billing for each workspace is done separately.
If you want upgrade, please go to "Workspace"" > "Subscription" page.

Please refer to the actual pricing [here](https://edensapp.com/pricing).

## How to delete a workspace?
