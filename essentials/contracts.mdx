## What is a contract?

In Edens, any legal document you may need is considered a contract. Examples of such documents include:

- Independent Contractor Agreement
- Non-Disclosure Agreement
- Master Service Agreement
- Statement of Work
- Payment Agreement

## Creating a contract

<Steps>
  <Step title="New contract">
    Go to the "Contracts" page and click the "New contract" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set contract details">
    You can choose one of the available templates. Don't worry; you can always customize any text in the document. Set a contract name, which will be used in the interface only to easily identify a contract. Choose the client and projects to which the contract should be linked, and click the "Create" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contract Editor">
    In the contract editor, you'll see highlighted fields that need to be filled to generate a final document. Once all required details are provided, a progress bar at the top of the page will be full, and you'll see the "Finalize" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign a contract">
    Once the contract is finalized, you can sign it. Please review everything carefully and sign. Then you can share the contract with your client.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send to the client to sign">
    After signing a contract, your client needs to sign it too. You can send an email or share a private link where the client will be able to review and sign the contract.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contract is signed">
    When the contract is signed by your client, it's considered signed. You and your client will receive an email containing a PDF document with both signatures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unsign a contract">
    Before a contract is signed, you can un-sign it and revert it to draft status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Edens supports special tags for working with document variables:

- `{% field /%}` is used to define data that needs to be filled by the user.
- `{% var /%}` is used to highlight a field in the document.
- `{% $variable %}` is used to render a variable.

While the contracts are still beta, additional documentation on them will be available at a later date. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact the support team.
